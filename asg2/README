#I completed all of the base code implementing all of the code,
#linking between all the classes with functions for each case
# of the main switch statement.
#
# To the Grader- I understand that none of my tests will work, I am
# confident however that it is because of the bug making me declare
# dllist.position throughout the code rather than lines.position
# (the one created in the edfile class). I see no flaw in any of
# the logic of my functions. It refused to compile without declaring dllist :(.
